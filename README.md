# WeeklyChallengeOne


This project contains bugs and errors. You have to solely fix them up and find the best possible way to make the application run.

After you have successfully fixed it, you have to materialize it :smiley:. Use your creativity and showcase it in #showcase channel.

When you have fixed the errors just send a Pull Request to this GitHub repo.


## Where are the errors :
